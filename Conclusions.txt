On a brief analysis of the data I wanted to do looks into which conservation type gets seen the most to see
if it correlates to the population levels and what parks see the most action. I started by filling in
null values for conservation status to unknown to make the readability a little easier for people looking
at the chart. When looking at the data, animals that are in recovery have a lot more sightings than animals
in any of the dangerous categories. The three dangerous categories all share a similar mean but as you go up the highs 
get higher and higher lows as well. This makes sense since animals that are having population issues will be harder
to see. As for parks Yellowstone is way ahead in how many observations occur while there. We don't have this data
but this would make me want to view the amount of visitors each park gets. This could help us see if there is a 
correlation between amount of observations and people there.
